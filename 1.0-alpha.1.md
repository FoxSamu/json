# JSON for Java 1.0-alpha.1

In 1.0-alpha.1 I wanna rewrite most of the API and work towards releasing 1.0. That means that 1.0-alpha.1 will not be backwards compatible with 0.3. The upcoming versions will focus on improving the API more, and increasing performance.

## What will change

- All deprecated features will be removed.
- The exceptions thrown while parsing will be generalized.
- The parser will be partially rewritten.
- Support for different flavors of JSON (such as JSON 5), will be delegated through an API, allowing for other flavors of JSON to be implemented.
- The codec API will be rewritten.
- Features for nesting and size control will be introduced.
- The serializer will be partially rewritten, and will be non-recursive.
- New functions for `JsonNode` will be added.
- A new visiting API will be introduced, to walk along `JsonNode`s or parser outputs.
- Advanced JSON querying, and the ability to set fields via querying.
- JS-alike operations (such as arithmetics) on JSON trees.
- Pattern matching on JSON trees.
- Preservation of comments in trees, and support for JSON with comments.

## What might be added
- An annotation processor that generates (de)serializing visitors from annotations.
- Support for converting from and to GSON and Jackson models in a separate module.
- A template language engine to dynamically generate JSON (see the `template` branch for experiments related to that).
